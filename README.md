# Jonathan Tessier

## About
I am currently completing a Master’s degree of Mathematics (Applied Math - Fluid Mechanics) and I am looking for PhD opportunities to start in the Fall of 2022.

## Education
Bachelor of Mathematics in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo (2020).

Master of Mathematics (Applied Math) at the University of Waterloo (2022).

Candidate for a PhD in Oceanography (Physical Oceanography) at l'Université du Québec à Rimouski (UQAR).

## Research
My current research interests concern the stability of various flows in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) and Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The bulk of my research experience has been the numerical study of the Shallow-Water equations, the Quasi-Geostrophic equations, and their MHD counter parts.
